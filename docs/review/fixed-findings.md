# Fixed Findings

## 2026-04-23

### architecture-review.md / H-01

- Status: fixed
- Scope: `server.js` was reduced to the CLI/bootstrap and runtime composition root; subsystem logic moved into `server/data-runtime.js`, `server/background-runtime.js`, `server/auto-import-runtime.js`, and `server/http-router.js`.
- Guardrails: `docs/architecture.md` now documents the server split, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` prevents runtime modules from coupling back to `server.js`, the router, or each other, and `tests/unit/background-runtime.test.ts` locks the background registry snapshot behavior that was tightened during the review cycle.
- Follow-up quality fixes during implementation:
  - `server/background-runtime.js`: removed a snapshot TOCTOU re-read so background pruning now decides cleanup from one captured registry read.
  - `src/components/layout/FilterBar.tsx`: added cleanup for queued focus-restoration callbacks; `tests/frontend/filter-bar-date-picker.test.tsx` now covers the unmount path that was causing the flaky date-picker teardown in Playwright.
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:architecture`
  - `npm run check:deps`
  - `npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/server-helpers-network.test.ts tests/unit/server-helpers-runner-core.test.ts tests/unit/server-helpers-runner-process.test.ts tests/unit/server-helpers-file-locks.test.ts tests/integration/server-auto-import.test.ts tests/integration/server-background.test.ts tests/integration/server-api-guards.test.ts`
  - `npm run verify:full`
  - `coderabbit review --agent -t uncommitted -c AGENTS.md` -> round 1: 1 minor issue, round 2: 0 issues
